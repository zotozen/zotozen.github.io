                                Keylontic Science is a spiritual and metaphysical framework that explores the nature of reality, consciousness, and the mechanics of creation from a multidimensional perspective. It delves into concepts such as energy fields, sacred geometry, and the interconnectedness of all life forms across different dimensions and timelines.

                                frequency within our Time Matrix. Any race who has lost the memory of their connection
                                with Source/God cannot reach above 11.5 dimensions of energy.
                                Therefore, if we utilize the dimension 12 - Christos Maharta Frequency, by using
                                the Eckasha Maharic Seal, then we can create a pillar of D-12 energy within and

                            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">How do I know if a technique is working?</h3>
                        </div>

                            <p class="text-gray-600">This is a concern shared by many people. There are three primary modes by which one can experience a technique or meditation: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Visual or auditory experience may seem more familiar to us and, if that is what we are expecting when we work with techniques, we may feel that nothing is happening if we neither see nor hear anything!</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">However, people who are interested in exploring consciousness and growth are often more aligned with a kinesthetic, or feeling sense, a type of direct cognition that can seem more elusive and less quantifiable than seeing or hearing, but which is equally valid.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Kinesthetic experience or direct knowing is closely related to our intuitive and imaginative faculties which is perhaps why, especially in the beginning, it is easy to doubt our experience. 'Did I experience something, or did I just imagine it?'</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">When this happens, it can take a while to learn to trust our inner processes and to realize that we may be experiencing far more than is immediately apparent. For example, we may see only black when we go on an inner journey, but we may still be able to describe every detail!</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">We may get a sense of a color without seeing it, or a sound without hearing it. We may even smell a color or hear a picture!</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Kathara Level 1 explores the full spectrum of human sense facilities, which includes Higher Sensory Perception. The five senses with which we are already familiar are all associated with the Incarnate level of our identity (the level we interact with in our everyday lives).</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">The other seven senses are linked with the higher dimensional aspects of our being e.g. the Soul or Oversoul or even higher, and include facilities such as reading energy signatures or the ability to project one's consciousness.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Often when we do not seem to be hearing or seeing anything, it is because we are sensing from these higher levels of perception. At these levels, it is the ability to sense the core energy or integrity of an experience, being, or place that is paramount.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">It is often a question of sensing the essence of an energy signature rather than its outer manifestation in a visual or auditory sense, although this can also be accompanied by inner vision or hearing.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Apart from learning to trust ourselves again, and to trust our unique mode of experiencing creation, another way of knowing that 'something is happening' is to observe any tangible changes in our everyday lives: are we happier, more peaceful, more aware or enthusiastic, more grounded or centered?</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">For some, these barometers of change might precede more vivid inner experiences. KS technologies are not so much about having dramatic interdimensional adventures as they are about bringing and integrating our higher dimensional selves into our Incarnate, physical bodies here.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">In this context, it is the growing level of integration in our daily lives and consciousness that is an even more valid yardstick by which to measure the effectiveness of these techniques.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">People who function more from a kinesthetic or direct cognition perspective may find it becomes easier to trust their internal experiences when they notice palpable benefits in their lives.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">As we connect more and more with our higher levels of consciousness we will remember our True Expression and our means of experiencing our surroundings will become enhanced.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Until we have expanded to that point of our awareness, it is sometimes necessary to simply allow the process to unfold, and in so doing we must find within the Inner Trust and Guidance that we may currently feel is not there.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Simply because we ARE Energetic Beings, we constantly send and receive energy. This is dynamic to our existence. As you continue forth with your expansion process, you will discover your ways of communicating with yourself and your surroundings.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-600">Until that point it is simply a matter of re-learning to trust your power and realizing that a higher part of yourself has guided you to this point of expansion.</p>

                                Keylontic Science and the Mechanics of Creation
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Through the Teachings of Keylontic Science, we learn the "Mechanics of Creation" and discover that Earth and its life-forms exist in a 15 Dimensional Time Matrix, a holographic system created by Source (God) to experience anything it desires.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">All things and life expressions occur within Source's energy, and nothing can be separated from Source, as everything is created from its energy.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Source experiences individuation and the illusion of time and space within a time matrix through a process of "stepping down" its conscious energy into smaller pieces.</p>
                                The Process of Ascension
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Ascension is the process of merging the many parts of our conscious energy within the 15-dimensional time matrix, bringing them into conscious connection with each other to experience "At-One-Ment" with Source.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Through Ascension, we transmute our physical body form by integrating multiple levels of conscious energy, effectively expanding ourselves and merging with Source's infinite conscious energy.</p>
                                Integration and Evolution
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Integration of higher identities changes the biological form, making biological and spiritual evolution one.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Originally, identity integration occurred through one immortal lifetime, but due to distortions, the process now takes place through successive reincarnations.</p>
                                Distortions and Healing
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Distortions in the Energetic Manifestation Template (Kathara Grid) have resulted in an inability to undergo natural biological Ascension.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Through Keylontic Science, we can reclaim our immortal bodies and re-enter our natural state of evolution, healing distortions and remembering our true divine structure.</p>
                                Levels of Consciousness
                                <p class="text-gray-600">Each level of consciousness within the 15-dimensional time matrix is part of us, with names like Soul, Over-soul, Avatar, and Rishi.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">As we integrate these parts through Soul Integration, we become more aware of them and can access their knowledge and understanding.</p>
                                Stellar Activation Cycle
                                <p class="text-gray-600">The Earth and its races are in a Stellar Activation Cycle (SAC), a 26,556-year cycle that accelerates biological Ascension.</p>
                                <p class="text-gray-600">From 2000 to 2012, frequencies from the outer levels of the 15-dimensional time matrix will anchor into the planetary grids, allowing Humans to receive them and assist in anchoring.</p>
                                Personal Challenges and Growth
                                <p class="text-gray-600">By assisting in anchoring frequencies, Humans will face personal challenges due to distortions in their energetic templates but will also heal their templates and assist other life forms in undergoing Ascension.</p>
